# Charm of Plant Command
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This fist-sized charm is made from a bundle of dried plant stems wrapped in silver thread. Hung on a leather thong, it is typically worn around the neck or attached to a belt.

This charm has 3 charges. While you bear the charm, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the [speak with plants](/2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/speak-with-plants.md) spell. For the duration of the spell, you also have advantage on Charisma checks made to influence the behavior, demeanor, and attitude of plants. The charm regains all expended charges at dawn each day.
