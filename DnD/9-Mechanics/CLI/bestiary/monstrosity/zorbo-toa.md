# [Zorbo](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/zorbo-toa.md)
*Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 241*  

A zorbo (pronounced ZOR-boh) is a ferocious omnivore similar in size and appearance to a koala. Living in trees and caves, it has long claws, a dour disposition, and a fondness for humanoid flesh. A zorbo alters its natural armor to match its surroundings, and it can weaken and destroy armor, shields, and protective magic items with its sharp claws.

    \ a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, one such item worn or carried\
    \ by the creature (the target's choice) magically deteriorates, taking a permanent\
    \ and cumulative âˆ’1 penalty to the AC it offers, and the zorbo gains a +1 bonus\
    \ to AC until the start of its next turn. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield\
    \ or magic item that drops to a 0 AC increase is destroyed."
