    \ While [poisoned](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way,\
    \ a target takes 5 (1d10) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A\
    \ target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the\
    \ effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also\
