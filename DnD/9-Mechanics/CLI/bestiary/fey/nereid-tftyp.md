# [Nereid](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/nereid-tftyp.md)
*Source: Tales from the Yawning Portal p. 240*  

One of the most inviting locations in the Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan is a gently illuminated pool of water, beside which sits a lovely being singing a pleasant tune. The figure is a nereidâ€”a fey water creature that can shape its environment to suit its needs. Whether male or female, a nereid bears an otherworldly beauty.

- "desc": "The nereid wears a mantle of silky cloth the color of sea foam, which holds\

    \ it. If the mantle is destroyed, the nereid becomes [poisoned](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned)\

  "name": "Blinding Acid"
- "desc": "The nereid touches one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target\
    \ must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 22 (3d12 + 3) acid\

  "name": "Drowning Kiss (Recharge 5-6)"

    \ 17 (4d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and if it is a Large or smaller creature,\
    \ it is pushed up to 15 feet in a straight line or is knocked [prone](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone)\
    \ (nereid's choice). On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage\
    \ and isn't pushed or knocked [prone](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone)."
