    \ modes, Strength, and Dexterity are replaced by those of the new form, and it\
    \ gains any special senses, proficiencies, traits, actions, and reactions (except\
    \ class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but\
    \ that it lacks. It can cast its spells with verbal or somatic components in its\
    \ new form.\n\nThe new form's attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming\
    \ resistances and immunity to nonmagical attacks."
