    \ or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of Helga's\
    \ next turn."
  "name": "Regeneration"
- "desc": "Helga can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings,\
    \ without needing to make an ability check."
  "name": "Spider Climb"
- "desc": "Helga has the following flaws:\n\nForbiddance. Helga can't enter a residence\
    \ without an invitation from one of the occupants.\n\nHarmed by Running Water.\
    \ Helga takes 20 acid damage when it ends its turn in running water.\n\nStake\
    \ to the Heart. Helga is destroyed if a piercing weapon made of wood is driven\
    \ into its heart while it is [incapacitated](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated)\
    \ in its resting place.\n\nSunlight Hypersensitivity. Helga takes 20 radiant\
    \ damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage\

    \ by Helga, [incapacitated](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated),\
    \ or [restrained](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained). Hit: 6 (1d6\
    \ + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point\
    \ maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Helga\
    \ regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target\
    \ finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum\
    \ to 0."
