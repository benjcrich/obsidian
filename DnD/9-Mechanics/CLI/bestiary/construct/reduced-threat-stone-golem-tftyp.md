    \ Each target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic. On a failed\
    \ save, a target can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more\
    \ than one attack on its turn. In addition, the target can take either an action\
    \ or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A\
    \ target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the\
    \ effect on itself on a success."
