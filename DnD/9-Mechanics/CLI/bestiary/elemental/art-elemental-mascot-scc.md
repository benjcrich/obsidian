# [Art Elemental Mascot](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/art-elemental-mascot-scc.md)
*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 185*  

Often referred to as a "living expression," an art elemental is an aspect of creativity and emotion given physical formâ€”making it the perfect mascot for Prismari College.

To create an art elemental mascot, a mage draws power from a blend of all the natural elements, extracting their vibrant colors to craft a swirling outer shell before imbuing its core with a planar spirit. As creatures of both precise elemental study and rebellious expression, art elementals can both wreak elemental destruction and emotionally captivate the creatures around them.
