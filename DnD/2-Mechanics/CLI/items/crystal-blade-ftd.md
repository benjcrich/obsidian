# Crystal Blade
*Generic Variant, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This magic sword's blade is fashioned from a horn or spine from a crystal dragon. When you hit with an attack roll using this sword, the target takes an extra `1d8` radiant damage.

The sword has 3 charges and regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. When you hit a creature with an attack roll using the sword, you can expend 1 charge to regain a number of hit points equal to the extra radiant damage the sword dealt.

While you're holding the sword, you can use a bonus action to cause it to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, to cause it to shed dim light in a 10-foot radius, or to douse the light.
