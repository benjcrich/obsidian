# Bottled Breath
*Potion, uncommon*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This bottle contains a breath of elemental air. When you inhale it, you either exhale it or hold it.

If you exhale the breath, you gain the effect of the [gust of wind](/2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gust-of-wind.md) spell. If you hold the breath, you don't need to breathe for 1 hour, though you can end this benefit early (for example, to speak). Ending it early doesn't give you the benefit of exhaling the breath.
