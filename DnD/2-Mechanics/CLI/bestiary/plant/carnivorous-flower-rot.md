  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8\
    \ + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC\
    \ 15 Constitution saving throw against disease or become [poisoned](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned)\
    \ until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat\
    \ the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure.\
    \ The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its\
    \ hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts\

    \ [stunned](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of the\
