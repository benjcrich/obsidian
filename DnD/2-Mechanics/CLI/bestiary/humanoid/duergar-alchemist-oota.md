- "desc": "For 1 minute, the duergar magically increases in size, along with anything\
    \ it is wearing or carrying. While enlarged, the duergar is Large, doubles its\
    \ damage dice on Strength-based weapon attacks (included in the attacks), and\
    \ makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage. If the duergar\
    \ lacks the room to become Large, it attains the maximum size possible in the\
    \ space available."

    \ until it attacks, casts a spell, or uses its Enlarge, or until its [concentration](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration)\
    \ is broken, up to 1 hour (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the\
