# [Fathomer](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/fathomer-pota.md)
*Source: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 207, Ghosts of Saltmarsh*  

Fathomers are cultists who have sealed a pact with Olhydra, Princess of Evil Water. In addition to their spellcasting abilities, fathomers have the ability to transform their bodies into water, taking serpent-like shapes. In their water serpent forms, fathomers gain many of the resistances elemental creatures possess, as well as the ability to grapple and crush their enemies with their watery bodies.

Fathomers often serve as spies, infiltrators, and assassins for the water cult, since they can slip under locked doors or pass through bars and similar obstacles with ease.

    \ slots, which it regains after finishing a short or long rest, and knows the\
    \ following warlock spells:\n\nCantrips (at will): [chill touch](/2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/chill-touch.md),\

- "desc": "The fathomer can use its action to polymorph into a Medium serpent composed\
    \ of water, or back into its true form. Anything the fathomer is wearing or carrying\
    \ is subsumed into the serpent form during the change, inaccessible until the\
    \ fathomer returns to its true form. The fathomer reverts to its true form after\
    \ 4 hours, unless it can expend another use of this trait. If the fathomer is\
    \ knocked [unconscious](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) or dies,\
    \ it also reverts to its true form.\n\nWhile in serpent form, the fathomer gains\
    \ a swimming speed of 40 feet, the ability to breathe underwater, immunity to\
    \ poison damage, as well as resistance to fire damage and bludgeoning, piercing,\
    \ and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. It also has immunity to the following\
    \ conditions: [exhaustion](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion), [grappled](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled),\
    \ [paralyzed](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed), [poisoned](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned),\

    \ [unconscious](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious). The serpent\
    \ form can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if water\
    \ can pass through a space, the serpent can do so without squeezing."
