# [Greater Zombie](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/greater-zombie-tftyp.md)
*Source: Tales from the Yawning Portal p. 237*  

Many of those who brave the Tomb of Horrors believe they have reached their ultimate destination when they disturb a skeletal figure inside a secluded crypt. It is, in fact, a greater zombie, a creature magically created from a humanoid corpse to be far more resilient than a typical zombie.

## Undead Nature

A zombie doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
