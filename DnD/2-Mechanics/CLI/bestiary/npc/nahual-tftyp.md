- "desc": "The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium\
    \ humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than\
    \ its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying\
    \ isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies."

- "desc": "If the doppelganger surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during\

    \ 60 feet of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt,\
    \ 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While\
    \ the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts,\
    \ as long as the doppelganger's [concentration](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration)\
    \ isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind,\
    \ the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom ([Insight](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight))\
    \ and Charisma ([Deception](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception), [Intimidation](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Intimidation),\
