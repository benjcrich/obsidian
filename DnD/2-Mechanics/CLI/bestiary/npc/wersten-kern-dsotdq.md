# [Wersten Kern](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/wersten-kern-dsotdq.md)
*Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen p. 209*  

Wersten Kern is Lord Soth's standard bearer and champion. As with many of Soth's knights, she died alongside her liege during the Cataclysm and was cursed with undeath. In battle, she wields a wicked pike that flies Soth's black rose standard, and her cries can stop mighty warriors' hearts. Wersten staunchly follows Soth's commands, and she will serve him until she faces a second doom.

    \ sprout from the creature's body while it is cursed, imposing disadvantage on\

    \ of Wersten for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much\
    \ damage and isn't [frightened](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened).\
    \ At the end of each of its turns, a [frightened](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened)\
    \ creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success."
