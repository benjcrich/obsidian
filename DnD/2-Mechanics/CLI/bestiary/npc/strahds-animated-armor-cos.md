# [Strahd's Animated Armor](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/strahds-animated-armor-cos.md)
*Source: Curse of Strahd p. 227*  

The armor that Strahd wore into battle when he was alive lives on today as a headless, animated suit of plate armor. The armor is painted burgundy and adorned with golden angelic motifs.

## Thing of Evil

Strahd imbued his automaton with a sliver of his being, bequeathing unto his armor a malevolence not found in most animated objects. He also fortified his armor and placed a number of permanent spell effects on it to make the armor a better castle defender.

The armor understands Common but obeys only the commands of its master.
