# Booming Blade
*cantrip, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (5-feet radius)
- **Components:** S, a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp
- **Duration:** 1 round

You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects and then becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, the target takes `1d8` thunder damage, and the spell ends.

This spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra `1d8` thunder damage to the target on a hit, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to `2d8`. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (`2d8` and `3d8`) and again at 17th level (`3d8` and `4d8`).

**Classes**: [Artificer](/2-Mechanics/CLI/classes/artificer-tce.md), [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/2-Mechanics/CLI/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/2-Mechanics/CLI/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md), [Sorcerer](/2-Mechanics/CLI/classes/sorcerer.md), [Warlock](/2-Mechanics/CLI/classes/warlock.md), [Wizard](/2-Mechanics/CLI/classes/wizard.md)
