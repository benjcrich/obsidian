# Treebane
*Melee Weapon, unknown (magic)*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d8 S
  - Two-handed: 1d10 S
- **Properties**: Martial, [Versatile](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

The axe's handle is carved with leaves and vines, and it weighs half as much as a normal battleaxe. When the axe hits a plant, whether an ordinary plant or a plant creature, the target takes an extra `1d8` slashing damage. When a creature of non-good alignment wields the axe, it sprouts thorns whenever its wielder makes an attack with it. These thorns prick the wielder for 1 piercing damage after the attack is made, and this damage is considered magical.
