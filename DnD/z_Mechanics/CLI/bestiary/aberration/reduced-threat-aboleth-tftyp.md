  "name": "Amphibious"
- "desc": "While underwater, the aboleth is surrounded by transformative mucus. A\
    \ creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack while\
    \ within 5 feet of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure,\
    \ the creature is diseased for 1d4 hours. The diseased creature can breathe\
    \ only underwater."
  "name": "Mucous Cloud"

  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6\
    \ + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a\
    \ DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The disease has no effect\
    \ for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that cures disease. After 1 minute,\
    \ the diseased creature's skin becomes translucent and slimy, the creature can't\
    \ regain hit points unless it is underwater, and the disease can be removed only\
    \ by [heal](/2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/heal.md) or another disease-curing spell of\
    \ 6th level or higher. When the creature is outside a body of water, it takes\
    \ 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to the skin\
    \ before 10 minutes have passed."

    \ must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically [charmed](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed)\
    \ by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on a different plane of\
    \ existence from the target. The [charmed](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed)\
    \ target is under the aboleth's control and can't take reactions, and the aboleth\
    \ and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.\n\
    \nWhenever the [charmed](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) target\
    \ takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect\
    \ ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving\
    \ throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the aboleth."

    \ equal to the damage the creature takes."
