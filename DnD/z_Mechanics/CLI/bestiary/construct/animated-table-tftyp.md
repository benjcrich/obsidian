# [Animated Table](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/animated-table-tftyp.md)
*Source: Tales from the Yawning Portal p. 230*  

## Arundil's Animated Objects

A century ago, the dwarf mage Arundil animated a number of objects to defend the Foundry against intruders other than dwarves. Many of these creations remain in place today.

These animated objects never attack dwarves or duergar. In addition, a dwarf (including a duergar) can order an object to cease its attack. If so commanded, the object becomes immobile for 10 minutes, or until the one commanding it leaves the area.

### Constructed Nature

An animated table doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
