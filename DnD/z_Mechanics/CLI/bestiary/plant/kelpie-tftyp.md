  "name": "Amphibious"
- "desc": "The kelpie can use its action to reshape its body into the form of a humanoid\
    \ or beast that is Small, Medium, or Large. Its statistics are otherwise unchanged.\
    \ The disguise is convincing, unless the kelpie is in bright light or the viewer\
    \ is within 30 feet of it, in which case the seams between the seaweed strands\
    \ are visible. The kelpie returns to its true form if takes a bonus action to\
    \ do so or if it dies."
  "name": "Seaweed Shape"
- "desc": "While the kelpie remains motionless in its true form, it is indistinguishable\
    \ from normal seaweed."
  "name": "False Appearance"
"actions":
- "desc": "The kelpie makes two slam attacks."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d8\
    \ + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is\
    \ [grappled](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 12)."
  "name": "Slam"
- "desc": "The kelpie chooses one humanoid it can see within 150 feet of it. If the\
    \ target can see the kelpie, the target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving\
    \ throw or be magically [charmed](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed)\
    \ while the kelpie maintains [concentration](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration),\
    \ up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). The [charmed](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed)\
    \ target is [incapacitated](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated),\
    \ and instead of holding its breath underwater, it tries to breathe normally and\
    \ immediately runs out of breath, unless it can breathe water. If the [charmed](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed)\
    \ target is more than 5 feet away from the kelpie, the target must move on its\
    \ turn toward the kelpie by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet.\
    \ It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks.\n\nBefore moving into damaging terrain,\
    \ such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than\
    \ the kelpie or drowning, the target can repeat the saving throw. A [charmed](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed)\
    \ target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If\
    \ the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.\n\nA target that successfully\
    \ saves is immune to this kelpie's hypnosis for the next 24 hours."
