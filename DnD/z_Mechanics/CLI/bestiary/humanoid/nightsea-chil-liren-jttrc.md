# [Nightsea chil-liren](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/nightsea-chil-liren-jttrc.md)
*Source: Journeys through the Radiant Citadel p. 177*  

Janya is populated by descendants of Djaynai who escaped into the sea during the Passage of Vultures. The magic of Djaynaian transmuters and that of the Nightsea itself gave these people the ability to live beneath the waves. Now known as Nightsea chil-liren, the people of Janya look similar to the humans of Djaynai, but their brown skin is often tinged shades of gray, and eel-like fins run along their arms and legs.
