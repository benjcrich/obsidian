# [Geryon](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/geryon-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 136, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 173*  

Geryon is locked in an endless struggle with Levistus for control of Stygia. The two have fought for centuries, each displacing the other innumerable times. Currently, Levistus claims lordship over Stygia, but he has been trapped in an enormous block of ice at the command of Asmodeus. In response, Geryon is marshaling his followers, hoping to use this opportunity to replace his hated rival.

Among the archdevils, Geryon is known for his martial prowess. He is a ferocious hunter and a relentless tracker. He often joins his troops in battle; he loves to feel flesh and steel sundered beneath his claws and to taste his foes' blood. Yet Geryon's ferocity has also limited his ability to collect souls and forge an effective hierarchy. Sages who study the Nine Hells believe the battle for control of Stygia is a test staged by Asmodeus in hopes of purging the worst impulses from both Geryon and Levistusâ€”or discovering a competent replacement for both.

## Geryon's Lair

Geryon has recently reclaimed his ancient fortress, Coldsteel, a sprawling complex that rises from the icy center of Stygia. He roams the passages, spitting oaths of vengeance against Asmodeus and hatching schemes to reclaim his standing from Levistus. The challenge rating of Geryon is 23 (50,000 XP) when he's encountered in his lair.
