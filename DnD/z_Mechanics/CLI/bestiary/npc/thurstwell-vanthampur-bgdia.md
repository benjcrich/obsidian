# [Thurstwell Vanthampur](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/thurstwell-vanthampur-bgdia.md)
*Source: Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus p. 34*  

Thurstwell is a pale and sullen recluse in his forties. A veritable shut-in, he uses imps to spy on his brothers, Amrik and Mortlock. Thurstwell resents both of themâ€”Amrik for being their mother's favorite, and Mortlock for being a monstrous dolt.
