# [Kansaldi Fire-Eyes](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/kansaldi-fire-eyes-dsotdq.md)
*Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen p. 203*  

High Master Kansaldi Fire-Eyes leads the Red Dragon Army's offensive in Solamnia. A fanatical adherent of the Dragon Queen, Kansaldi was indoctrinated into the god's worship by Dragon High Lord Verminaard. During a test of faith from her mentor, Kansaldi replaced her left eye with a gem of seeing. This gem smolders and glows red whenever Kansaldi uses her magic, and her followers claim it allows her to see through any lie.

Highlord Verminaard follows visions from the Dragon Queen on a campaign south. In his absence, he left a powerful contingent of the Red Dragon Army under Kansaldi's command and ordered her to claim the Kalaman region in the Dragon Queen's name. Kansaldi pursues these orders with a fanatic's zeal. For her, there is no possibility of defeatâ€”there is only the Dragon Queen's will.
