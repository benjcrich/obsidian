	- Knowing how auth works into GCP
	- Knowing how what implementations at tools need to be better implemented
	- Own vuln management and make sure that's rock solid. 
	- **Figure out how to define a cloud security engineer**
	- That promotion needs to be very clear that I have that level of ownership to everyone involved. 
	- Time demonstrating the new level
		- If we go to hire a senior eng, we're not going to hire a jr that promises they can do the work. 
		- They need to see that I can work at a senior level for an extended period of time. 
			- John thinks I can perform at that level. He just needs to see it. 
	- Get good feedback from Infra team about what they're seeing and how I'm contributing. 
		- Invite John to strategy meetings so he can see what I'm working on and how I'm doing it.
