**Iroas's Villains**

| dice: d6 | Villain |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | A [knight](/2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) in the polis guard regularly subjects his soldiers to extreme disciplinary techniques, leading them to start a revolt. |
| 2 | A general ([Akroan hoplite](/2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/akroan-hoplite-mot.md); see "chapter 6") commands a town be put to the torch for its soldiers' crimes. Followers of Phenax are actually responsible for the crimes and are framing the community so it will be destroyed and turned into a haven for the Returned. |
| 3 | An aging athlete ([gladiator](/2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md)) pursues sinister magic to aid his performance at the cost of innocent lives. |
| 4 | The government of a polis fearful of impending war forces farmers to join a militia, precipitating a famine as crops are left untended. |
| 5 | A [priest](/2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) tries to undermine the servants of other gods by forcing them into duels and shaming them if they lose. |
| 6 | A gifted orator ([noble](/2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) offers honest but scathing criticism of a champion of Iroas. The champion demands recompense, and the orator needs support against this threat. |
