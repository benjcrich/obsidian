# Infestation
*cantrip, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a living flea
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause a cloud of mites, fleas, and other parasites to appear momentarily on one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it takes `1d6` poison damage and moves 5 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 5 feet. Roll a `d4` for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move.

The spell's damage increases by `1d6` when you reach 5th level (`2d6`), 11th level (`3d6`), and 17th level (`4d6`).
