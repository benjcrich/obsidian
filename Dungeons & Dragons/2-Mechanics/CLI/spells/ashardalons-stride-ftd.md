- **Casting time:** 1 bonus

The billowing flames of a dragon blast from your feet, granting you explosive speed. For the duration, your speed increases by 20 feet and moving doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

When you move within 5 feet of a creature or an object that isn't being worn or carried, it takes `1d6` fire damage from your trail of heat. A creature or object can take this damage only once during a turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, increase your speed by 5 feet for each spell slot level above 3rd. The spell deals an additional 1d6 fire damage for each slot level above 3rd.

**Classes**: [Artificer](/2-Mechanics/CLI/classes/artificer-tce.md), [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/2-Mechanics/CLI/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Ranger](/2-Mechanics/CLI/classes/ranger.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/2-Mechanics/CLI/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md), [Sorcerer](/2-Mechanics/CLI/classes/sorcerer.md), [Wizard](/2-Mechanics/CLI/classes/wizard.md)
