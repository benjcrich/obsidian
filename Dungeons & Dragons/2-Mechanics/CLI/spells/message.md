# Message
*cantrip, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a short piece of copper wire
- **Duration:** 1 round

You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.

**Classes**: [Artificer](/2-Mechanics/CLI/classes/artificer-tce.md), [Bard](/2-Mechanics/CLI/classes/bard.md), [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/2-Mechanics/CLI/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/2-Mechanics/CLI/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md), [Sorcerer](/2-Mechanics/CLI/classes/sorcerer.md), [Wizard](/2-Mechanics/CLI/classes/wizard.md)
