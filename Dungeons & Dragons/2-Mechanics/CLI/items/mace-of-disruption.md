# Mace of Disruption
*Melee Weapon, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/2-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/mace-of-disruption.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d6 B
- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

When you hit a fiend or an undead with this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra `2d6` radiant damage. If the target has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature becomes [frightened](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of you until the end of your next turn.

While you hold this weapon, it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.
