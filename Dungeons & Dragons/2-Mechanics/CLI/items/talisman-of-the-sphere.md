![](/2-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/talisman-of-the-sphere.webp#right)  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

When you make an Intelligence ([Arcana](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check to control a [sphere of annihilation](/2-Mechanics/CLI/items/sphere-of-annihilation.md) while you are holding this talisman, you double your proficiency bonus on the check. In addition, when you start your turn with control over a [sphere of annihilation](/2-Mechanics/CLI/items/sphere-of-annihilation.md), you can use an action to levitate it 10 feet plus a number of additional feet equal to 10 × your Intelligence modifier.
