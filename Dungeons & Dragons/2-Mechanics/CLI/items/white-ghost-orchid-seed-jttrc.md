More rarely, the orchids produce a smaller pod holding a single white seed. Among its various magical properties, if a white seed is ground and scattered over a dead body, the body is affected by the [resurrection](/2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/resurrection.md) spell. A white ghost orchid seed has no effect if consumed.
