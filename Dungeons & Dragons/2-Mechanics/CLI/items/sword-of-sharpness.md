# Sword of Sharpness
*Generic Variant, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/2-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/sword-of-sharpness.webp#right)  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

When you attack an object with this magic sword and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.

When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 14 slashing damage. Then roll another `d20`. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target's limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the DM. If the creature has no limb to sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.

> [!note]
> According to the SRD, it is an extra `4d6` slashing damage, although this is incorrect (https://rpg.stackexchange.com/a/174522/53884).

In addition, you can speak the sword's command to cause the blade to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or sheathing the sword puts out the light.
