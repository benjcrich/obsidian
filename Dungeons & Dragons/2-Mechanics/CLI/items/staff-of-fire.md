# Staff of Fire
*Staff, major, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  
![](/2-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/staff-of-fire.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

You have resistance to fire damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [burning hands](/2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/burning-hands.md) (1 charge), [fireball](/2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fireball.md) (3 charges), or [wall of fire](/2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-fire.md) (4 charges).

The staff regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 1, the staff blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is destroyed.
