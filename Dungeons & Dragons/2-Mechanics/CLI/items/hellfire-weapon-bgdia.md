This weapon is fashioned from infernal iron and traced with veins of hellfire that shed dim light in a 5-foot-radius.

Any humanoid killed by an attack made with this weapon has its soul funneled into the River Styx, where it's reborn instantly as a [lemure](/2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/lemure.md) devil.
