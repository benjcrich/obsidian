# Potion of Mind Control (monster)
*Potion, very rare*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

When you drink a potion of mind control, you can cast a dominate spell (save DC 15) on a specific creature if you do so before the end of your next turn. If you don't, the potion is wasted.

A potion of mind control produces the effect of a [dominate monster](/2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dominate-monster.md) spell. If the target's initial saving throw fails, the effect lasts for 1 hour, with no [concentration](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration) required on your part. The [charmed](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) creature has disadvantage on new saving throws to break the effect during this time.
