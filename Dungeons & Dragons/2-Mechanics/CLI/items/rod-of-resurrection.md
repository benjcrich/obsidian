# Rod of Resurrection
*Rod, major, legendary (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)*  
![](/2-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/rod-of-resurrection.webp#right)  

- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

The rod has 5 charges. While you hold it, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: [heal](/2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/heal.md) (expends 1 charge) or [resurrection](/2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/resurrection.md) (expends 5 charges).

The rod regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If the rod is reduced to 0 charges, roll a `d20`. On a 1, the rod disappears in a burst of radiance.
