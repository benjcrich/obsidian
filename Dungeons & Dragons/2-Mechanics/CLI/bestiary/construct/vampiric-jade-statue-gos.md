# [Vampiric Jade Statue](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/vampiric-jade-statue-gos.md)
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 256*  

A large, exquisitely carved jade statue of a vampire guards the tunnels in Isle of the Abbey, having been brought to life by dark magic. Its stone fangs draw blood that it then uses to work a curse on its victims.
