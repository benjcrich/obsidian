# [Living Bigby's Hand](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/living-bigbys-hand-idrotf.md)
*Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 298*  

A living Bigby's hand is a Large, hovering hand of shimmering, translucent force. It often serves as a guardian, attacking creatures that cross its path while remaining loyal to its caster.

Areas of wild magic and sites that have been ravaged by powerful eldritch forces can give rise to spell effects that become living beings. These so-called living spells haunt the places where they were created, subsisting on ambient magical energy.
