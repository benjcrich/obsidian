# [Ruin Grinder](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/ruin-grinder-scc.md)
*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 211*  

Created by the archaeomancers of Lorehold College, ruin grinders are mighty automatons built to excavate ancient ruins and artifacts. The massive toothed shovels attached to a ruin grinder's arms tear through millennia-old bedrock with ease, leading some Lorehold mages to fear that the grinders destroy more history than they unearth.
