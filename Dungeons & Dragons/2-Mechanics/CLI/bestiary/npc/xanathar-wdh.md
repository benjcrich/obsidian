# [Xanathar](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/xanathar-wdh.md)
*Source: Waterdeep: Dragon Heist p. 220*  

Xanathar is the name given to the beholder crime lord that lives in the dungeons under Waterdeep. It isn't the first beholder to claim this mantle, nor will it be the last.

Like all beholders, Xanathar is a paranoid tyrant that charms and bullies its minions into servitude. The Xanathar Guild is made up of some of Waterdeep's most disreputable folk, as well as monsters forced into subservience or drawn to the beholder by the promise of treasure, food, or power. Treachery within the ranks of the guild is common as servants vie for the beholder's favor and affection. Such boons are fleeting, though, as the beholder is quick to distrust those who finagle their way into its good graces.

Xanathar lives in a dungeon under Skullport, a subterranean settlement connected to Undermountain's third level. The place resembles a ramshackle town, built inside a giant cavern connected to an underground river. Members of the Xanathar Guild haunt Skullport's dilapidated buildings, and flameskulls patrol its streets.

The only creature Xanathar truly cares about aside from itself is a fish, named Sylgar, that it keeps in a large glass tank. Xanathar has minions that look after the fish constantly, but even their ministrations can't keep such a creature alive forever. Whenever the fish dies, panic spreads through the occupants of the lair as minions try to replace the fish before Xanathar realizes what has happened. Luckily for them, the beholder can't tell one fish from another.

Xanathar is extremely fond of gold. A few years ago, its spies stole the [Stone of Golorr](/2-Mechanics/CLI/items/stone-of-golorr-wdh.md), which contained information that led to the discovery of a dwarven vault under Waterdeep. Xanathar was able to open the vault, but was forced out by the dragon inside the place. Recently, someone stole the [Stone of Golorr](/2-Mechanics/CLI/items/stone-of-golorr-wdh.md) from where it was hidden inside its lair, and the beholder is convinced that the Black Network is behind the theft.

The beholder is caught up in the unbreakable grip of its own paranoia. It sees enemies everywhere, and lashes out at anyone it suspects of being a Zhentarim spy or assassin. Adventurers who attract its attention by dealing with known or suspected Black Network operatives are quickly branded as enemies that must be destroyed.

- "desc": "Xanathar shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll\

    \n- 1. Charm Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving\
    \ throw or be [charmed](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by Xanathar\
    \ for 1 hour, or until Xanathar harms the creature.  \n- 2. Paralyzing Ray.\
    \ The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be\
    \ [paralyzed](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) for 1 minute. The\
    \ target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the\
    \ effect on itself on a success.  \n- 3. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must\
    \ succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened)\
    \ for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its\
    \ turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- 4. Slowing Ray. The\
    \ targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed\
    \ save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't\
    \ take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn,\
    \ not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its\
    \ turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- 5. Enervation Ray.\
    \ The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36\
    \ (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful\
    \ one.  \n- 6. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed\
    \ on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or Xanathar moves it up to 30 feet in any direction.\
    \ It is [restrained](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by the ray's\
    \ telekinetic grip until the start of Xanathar's next turn or until Xanathar is\
    \ [incapacitated](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).  \n\n \
    \   If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn\
    \ or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. Xanathar can also exert\
    \ fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or\
    \ opening a door or a container.  \n- 7. Sleep Ray. The targeted creature\
    \ must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain [unconscious](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious)\
    \ for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes\
    \ an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.  \n-\
    \ 8. Petrification Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity\
    \ saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is\
    \ [restrained](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained). It must repeat\
    \ the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends.\
    \ On a failure, the creature is [petrified](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#petrified)\
    \ until freed by the  [greater restoration](/2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md)\
    \ spell or other magic.  \n- 9. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature,\
    \ it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force\
    \ damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes\
    \ a pile of fine gray dust.  \n\n    If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical\
    \ object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw.\
    \ If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this\
    \ ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.  \n- 10. Death Ray. The targeted\
    \ creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10)\
    \ necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.  "
