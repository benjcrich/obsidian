    \ statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity,\
    \ and other actions are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics\
    \ and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions)\
    \ that the new form has but that it lacks. If the new form has a bite attack,\
    \ Eku can use its bite in that form."
