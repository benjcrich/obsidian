# [Deformed Duergar](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/deformed-duergar-wdmm.md)
*Source: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage p. 180*  

This creature used to be two separate duergar, a male named Blork and a female named Muatha. Arcturia fused them together into a single creature by using magic that only a [wish](/2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell can undo. Both skulls merged into one bulbous head that has three ears, three eyes, two noses, and two mouths. It has a third arm on the right side of its body, and its left leg splits into two at the knee, giving it three feet. The transformation drove the poor creature insane, and it regards all other creatures as threats that must be destroyed.
