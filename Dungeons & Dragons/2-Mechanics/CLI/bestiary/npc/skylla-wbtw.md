# [Skylla](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/skylla-wbtw.md)
*Source: The Wild Beyond the Witchlight p. 220*  

Skylla, who sometimes goes by the alias Charmay, forged a warlock's pact with Baba Yaga. It is from this powerful archfey that Skylla draws her magic.

Skylla is spiteful and treacherous, as likely to betray her allies as to help them. She talked Kelek into allowing her to serve as the primary liaison between the League of Malevolence and the Hourglass Coven, claiming her pact with Baba Yaga made her better suited for the role than anyone else. Endelyn Moongrave foresaw that Skylla's allies would turn on her one day and shared this information with the warlock. Skylla reacted to that news by distancing herself from the League of Malevolence, and now she works for Endelyn. Skylla is open to the idea of rejoining the league, but not while Kelek is in charge.
