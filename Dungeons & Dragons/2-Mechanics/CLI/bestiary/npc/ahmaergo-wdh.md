# [Ahmaergo](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ahmaergo-wdh.md)
*Source: Waterdeep: Dragon Heist p. 193*  

Ahmaergo, Xanathar's majordomo, has a fascination with minotaurs. Although outwardly civil, the shield dwarf is as devious and corrupt as the worst devil, yet also unflinchingly loyal to his beholder master.

After the beholder, Ahmaergo is the most influential member of the Xanathar Guild.
