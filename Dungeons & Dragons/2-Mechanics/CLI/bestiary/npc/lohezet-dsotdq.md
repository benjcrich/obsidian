# [Lohezet](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md)
*Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen p. 205*  

A black-robed member of the Mages of High Sorcery, Lohezet is a scholar obsessed with extinct creatures and fallen empires. He views the Dragon Army as a way to recreate the glories of Ansalon's past. During the Dragon Armies' invasions of Khur and Kendermore, Lohezet's investigations of Istarian ruins revealed the location of the flying city of Onyari. He now travels with the Red Dragon Army, intent on finding the City of Lost Names and restoring it to the skies.

Lohezet employs the strategies of extinct poisonous predators in battle. His magical toxins wear down even the strongest foes, providing him with the opportunity to escape or reducing his enemies to discolored corpses.
