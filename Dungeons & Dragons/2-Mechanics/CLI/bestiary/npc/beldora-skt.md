# [Beldora](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/beldora-skt.md)
*Source: Storm King's Thunder p. 249*  

Beldora is a member of the Harpers who survives using her wits and wiles. She looks like a homeless waif, but she's a survivor who shies away from material wealth.

Ideal:"We should all strive to help one another."

Bond:"I'll risk my life to protect the powerless."

Flaw:"I like lying to people. Makes life more interesting, no?"
