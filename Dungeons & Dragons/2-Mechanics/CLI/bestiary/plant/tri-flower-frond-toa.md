# [Tri-flower Frond](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/tri-flower-frond-toa.md)
*Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 234*  

When fully grown, a tri-flower frond stands 6 to 7 feet tall. It has three bright, trumpet-shaped flowers, each as large as a human head and each one a different color: intense red, vivid orange, and bright yellow. Each flower can harm a creature in a different terrible way.
