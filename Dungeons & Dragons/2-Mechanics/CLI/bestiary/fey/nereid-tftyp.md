# [Nereid](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/nereid-tftyp.md)
*Source: Tales from the Yawning Portal p. 240*  

One of the most inviting locations in the Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan is a gently illuminated pool of water, beside which sits a lovely being singing a pleasant tune. The figure is a nereid—a fey water creature that can shape its environment to suit its needs. Whether male or female, a nereid bears an otherworldly beauty.

    \ 17 (4d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and if it is a Large or smaller creature,\
    \ it is pushed up to 15 feet in a straight line or is knocked [prone](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone)\
