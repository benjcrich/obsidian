# [Hollyphant](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/hollyphant-bgdia.md)
*Source: Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus p. 237*  

Hollyphants are gentle, stalwart creatures native to the Upper Planes. Good-aligned deities and angels use them as messengers and helpers. Hollyphants treasure friendship and honesty.

A hollyphant looks like a miniature elephant with luminous gold fur and small, rapidly fluttering wings that not only hold it aloft but also propel it at great speed. Although kind, a hollyphant won't bear witness to an evil act without punishing the malefactor. Its pearlescent tusks are far from formidable, but it can unleash trumpet blasts from its trunk that can deafen creatures or engulf evildoers in radiant sparkles of positive energy. A hollyphant is also blessed with powerful innate magic to help it combat evil and protect its friends.

    \ objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot.\
    \ Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell\
    \ has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from\
    \ the areas affected by such spells. The hollyphant can use an action to suppress\
