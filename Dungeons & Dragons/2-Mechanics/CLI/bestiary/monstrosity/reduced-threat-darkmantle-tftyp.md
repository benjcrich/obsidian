    \ cave formation such as a stalactite or stalagmite."

"actions":
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d6\
    \ + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the darkmantle attaches to the target. If the\
    \ target is Medium or smaller and the darkmantle has advantage on the attack roll,\
    \ it attaches by engulfing the target's head, and the target is also [blinded](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded)\
    \ and unable to breathe while the darkmantle is attached in this way.\n\nWhile\
    \ attached to the target, the darkmantle can attack no other creature except the\
    \ target but has advantage on its attack rolls. The darkmantle's speed also becomes\
    \ 0, it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed, and it moves with the target.\n\
    \nA creature can detach the darkmantle by making a successful DC 13 Strength check\
    \ as an action. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach itself from the target\
    \ by using 5 feet of movement."
  "name": "Crush"
- "desc": "A 15-foot radius of magical darkness extends out from the darkmantle, moves\
    \ with it, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as long as the darkmantle\
    \ maintains [concentration](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration),\
    \ up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). Darkvision can't penetrate\
    \ this darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it. If any of the darkness\
    \ overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the\
    \ spell creating the light is dispelled."
