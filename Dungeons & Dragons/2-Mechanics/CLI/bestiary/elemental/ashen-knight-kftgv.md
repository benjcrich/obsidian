# [Ashen Knight](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/ashen-knight-kftgv.md)
*Source: Keys from the Golden Vault p. 158*  

Knights are warriors who pledge service to rulers, religious orders, and noble causes. A knight's alignment determines the extent to which a pledge is honored. Whether undertaking a quest or patrolling a realm, a knight often travels with an entourage that includes squires and hirelings who are commoners.
