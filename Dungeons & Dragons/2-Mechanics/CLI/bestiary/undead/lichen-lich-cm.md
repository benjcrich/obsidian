# [Lichen Lich](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/lichen-lich-cm.md)
*Source: Candlekeep Mysteries p. 223*  

Lichen liches are undead remnants of powerful druids.

A lichen lich looks like a skeleton covered with fungi and bark-like lichen. A lichen lich has vines within its chest cavity. These vines exude viscid and poisonous black fluid.
