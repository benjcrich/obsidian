# [Skeletal Swarm](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/skeletal-swarm-gos.md)
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 254*  

This swarm of bones found rising out of the sand in Isle of the Abbey is made from the remains of several animated skeletons. A skeletal swarm alternates its appearance between partially formed humanoid shapes and a chaotic, swirling mass.
