- "desc": "A creature that touches the Ooze Master or hits it with a melee attack\
    \ while within 5 feet of it takes 9 (2d8) acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon\
    \ that hits the Ooze Master corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a\
    \ permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to\
    \ −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition that hits the Ooze Master\
    \ is destroyed after dealing damage.\n\nThe Ooze Master can eat through 2-inch-thick,\
    \ nonmagical wood or metal in 1 round."

    \ 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker targets the creature\
    \ that is closest to it, not including itself or the Ooze Master. If multiple\
    \ creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. On a successful\
    \ save, the attacker is immune to this Instinctive Charm for 24 hours. Creatures\
    \ that can't be [charmed](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) are immune\
