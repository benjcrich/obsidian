    \ saving throw. On failed save, a target takes 13 (3d8) lightning damage. If\
    \ the target takes any of this damage, the target is [stunned](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned)\
    \ until the end of the eel's next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half\
    \ as much damage and isn't [stunned](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned)."
